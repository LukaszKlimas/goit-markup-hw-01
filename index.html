        SWORN BROTHERS’ OATH
        Cost: 10m + 1m from each Exalt bound by the spell
        Target: Exalts to be bound
        This Terrestrial Circle spell binds the Essences of a group of
        Exalts together and is used in the creation of sworn brotherhoods.
        The ritual takes one hour for a pair of Exalts, plus one hour for
        each additional Exalt. The sorcerer does not have to be one of the
        Exalted bound by the spell. Once the spell is cast, the sorcerer’s
        player makes an (Intelligence + Occult) roll. The number of
        successes scored creates a new trait for the members of the sworn
        brotherhood, Oathbond, which refl ects the strength of the spiritual
        bond between the members of the brotherhood. This trait has a
        number of effects on those who share the bond.
        • Familiarity: Members of a sworn brotherhood are aware of each
        others’ location. As long as a member of the brotherhood is within
        (Oathbond x 10) yards of another member, she knows exactly where
        he is. Beyond this range, a member’s player can make an Essence roll
        [00:31]
        as a diceless action for the Exalt to get an idea of the direction and
        range to any other member. One success gives the sister a general
        idea of distance and direction, three is suffi cient to get an accurate
        read on range and bearing, and fi ve successes tell the sister exactly
        where her brother is.
        • Devotion: Each member of the sworn brotherhood gains a Devotion
        dice pool, equal to their Oathbond rating, which refreshes
        once per story. These dice can be used—in any amount—on actions
        undertaken with the deliberate purpose of aiding another member
        of the brotherhood.
        • Loyalty: A character must score successes equal to his Oathbond
        on an extended Conviction roll to take any action that he knows
        will harm—mentally, emotionally or physically—another member
        of his brotherhood. Each time this action is taken, it reduces his
        Oathbond rating by one. If this reduces the Oathbond to 0, the
        character is no longer part of the brotherhood—in any magical
        way, at least.
        [00:31]
        A sorcerer is limited to binding no more Dragon Bloods into
        a single sworn brotherhood than an amount equal to twice his
        Essence, and an Exalt cannot be a member of more than one brotherhood.
        If the spell is cast upon someone who is already a member
        of a sworn brotherhood, the target’s Oathbond rating is used as a
        diffi culty modifi er for the ritual. Only those successes in excess of
        (the sworn character’s Oathbond + 1) are counted in the new Oath.
        If no successes are rolled, the spell fails completely.
        The effects of this spell are permanent, but if one or more
        members reduce their Oathbond to 0, the spell has no further effect
        on them. The Oathbond can be re-implemented, strengthening and
        deepening the bonds between members, but the cost is high. Each
        member must sacrifi ce a dot of permanent Willpower, and the caster
        of the spell sacrifi ces a dot of Permanent Essence in order to re-cast
        an existing Sworn Brothers’ Oath. (These dots can be re-purchased
        later with experience.) Under no circumstances can a character’s
        Oathbond rating exceed fi ve times the Permanent Essence of the
        [00:31]
        lowest Essence character in the brotherhood. Successes in excess
        of this rating are simply lost.
        Brotherhoods with Oathbond ratings higher than 10 are extremely
        uncommon and considered unnerving by others, as the bonds
        between the members begin to permeate all aspects of their lives.
        Extremely strong brotherhoods begin to act in disturbingly similar
        fashion. They do not lose their individual personalities, but unconscious
        habits, mannerisms, preferences and other traits blend and
        merge, giving the members an eerie sameness to their behavior.
